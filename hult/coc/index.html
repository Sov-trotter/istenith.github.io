                                    We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors;and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in and before organising/participating in Hult Prize. A reference to members includes volunteers, executive members and community leaders.The Code of Conduct applies to all technical activities and events in Hult Prize. Responsibility lies with every person covered by the Code of Conduct to conduct themselves in accordance with the Code of Conduct. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviouroccurring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.</p>
                                <h3>Every member should:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Recognise that diversity is strength and will seek to involve all people, as active participants in thecommunity.</li>
                                    <li>Strengthen the efforts of individuals and groups to meet community needs and make a difference.</li>
                                    <li>Strive for excellence in the delivery of our services and activities.</li>
                                    <li>Work with others through local and regional cross-sectoral links and partnerships to enhance community well-being.</li>

                                    <li>Be friendly and patient.</li>
                                    <li>Be welcoming.We strive to be a technical community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
